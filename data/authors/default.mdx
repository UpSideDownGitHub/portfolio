# Welcome to my website!

I am thrilled to have you here. Allow me to introduce myselfâ€”I am `Reuben Miller`, a dedicated and passionate 3rd year Games Programming student at the University of Northampton. With an unwavering fascination for the world of gaming and an insatiable curiosity for programming, I am determined to carve my path as a **Gameplay/AI Programmer**.

Ever since I laid my hands on a controller for the first time, I have been captivated by the boundless possibilities that video games offer. The way they transport us to immersive worlds and ignite our imagination is truly remarkable. As I delved deeper into the mechanics behind these interactive experiences, I discovered a profound desire to become the architect behind the scenes, shaping the very essence of gameplay and creating lifelike artificial intelligence that challenges players in unprecedented ways.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been honing my technical skills and expanding my knowledge of game development. With a solid foundation in programming languages such as **C++**, **C#**, and **Java**, I have explored various game engines, including **Unity**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Godot**, to bring my creative visions to life. I have also gained valuable experience in implementing gameplay mechanics, designing engaging enemies, and optimizing performance to ensure seamless player experiences.

As a Gameplay/AI Programmer, my ultimate goal is to create games that evoke emotions, spark joy, and leave a lasting impact on players. I believe that gameplay is the beating heart of any memorable gaming experience, and AI is the vital catalyst that breathes life into the virtual worlds we explore. By meticulously crafting engaging mechanics and building intelligent adversaries and allies, I aim to deliver unforgettable gameplay moments that will keep players immersed and coming back for more.

This portfolio website serves as a showcase of my projects, highlighting the diverse range of skills I have acquired and the creative endeavors I have embarked upon. I invite you to explore my work and witness my growth as a programmer and game developer. I am always eager to collaborate and learn from like-minded individuals, so please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:reubenmillerbusiness@gmail.com) if you share my passion for the intricate dance between code and gameplay.

In addition to showcasing my projects and skills, I am thrilled to share that my portfolio website also serves as a platform for my blog. As a passionate and enthusiastic Games Programming student, I believe in the power of knowledge sharing and fostering a sense of community within the gaming industry.
