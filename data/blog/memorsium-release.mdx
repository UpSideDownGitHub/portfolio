# 'Introduction:
Today, I am thrilled to announce the release of my second game, crafted during the renowned Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1. 
Join me as I delve into the captivating world of building a memory-based platformer, where players must rely on their 
ability to memorize the map before venturing forth into the unknown.

The Brackeys Game Jam:
The Brackeys Game Jam is a highly anticipated event that brings together passionate game developers from all over the world. 
With a set theme to adhere to, participants have a limited timeframe to create and submit their games. It is an exhilarating 
experience that fosters creativity, collaboration, and innovation.

# Game Description:
In this thrilling memory-based platformer, players embark on a journey where every step counts.
you are faced with the challenge of memorizing the layout of the level within a given time frame. Once the time is up, 
the map disappears, leaving you to traverse the platforms solely based on your memory.

The captivating twist lies in the game's adherence to the theme of "it is not real." The platforms themselves are not 
tangible, blurring the line between reality and illusion. Players must rely on their mental map, using their memory as 
a guiding force to overcome obstacles and reach their goals.

# 20 Levels of Memory Mastery:
My game features 20 levels, each presenting its own unique layout and intricacies. As players progress through the game, 
the complexity and challenge gradually increase, demanding heightened memory retention and swift decision-making.

# The importance of time management is not limited to the gameplay itself. In addition to completing the levels, 
players can strive to achieve the best times for each stage, fostering healthy competition and encouraging replayability.

# Crafting an Immersive Experience:
Developing a memory-based platformer required careful attention to detail and thoughtful design choices. 
I focused on creating visually satisfying effects that engage the player's senses and enhance the immersion. The absence of a 
visible map adds an element of suspense and excitement, intensifying the reliance on memory recall and quick reflexes.

# Iterative Development and Player Feedback:
Throughout the development process, I engaged in rigorous playtesting to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. 
Feedback from fellow developers and early players proved invaluable, helping me refine level designs, balance gameplay 
mechanics, and optimize user interfaces. This iterative approach ensured that my game provided a satisfying challenge 
while remaining accessible and enjoyable for players of varying skill levels.

# The Reception:
Overal i came *1070th* in the jam which is okay, and is an improvement from my first jam, i am very happy with how the game turned out
and am fond of the effects that i managed to create, but the visual side of the game still feel like they are laking.

# Conclusion:
Creating my second game for the Brackeys Game Jam was an incredible journey of exploration and innovation. Crafting a 
memory-based platformer allowed me to push the boundaries of traditional gameplay mechanics, challenging players to rely on 
their memory skills in an immersive and visually captivating experience.
